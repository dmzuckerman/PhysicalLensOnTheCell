<h3>
Goals
</h3>

<ul>
<li> Understand the physical driving forces behind cellular processes </li>

<li> Organize cellular processes into physical categories to facilitate transfer of understanding </li>

<li> Focus on deep understanding and specific examples because learning all cell biology is not an option </li>
</ul>


<h3>
Mantras
</h3>

<ul>
<li> All processes in the cell necessarily are driven by physical rules.  Otherwise, they wouldn't happen. </li>

<li> Biologists <i>and</i> physicists should understand how and why.  </li>

<li> The key physical principles can be understood through a relatively simple mass-action picture of non-equilibrium kinetics. 
 </li>
</ul>
