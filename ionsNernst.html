<h2>
A Half-Step Beyond Ideal: Ion Gradients and Transmembrane Potentials
</h2>

One key way the cell stores <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','free')">free energy</a> is by having different concentrations of molecules in different "compartments" - e.g., extra-cellular vs. intracellular or in an organelle compared to cytoplasm.
The molecules playing this role are charged molecules, or ions, such as sodium ($\plus{Na}$), chloride ($\minus{Cl}$), potassium ($\plus{K}$), calcium ($\dplus{Ca}$), and numerous nucleotide species.
A <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','ionsOverview')">brief overview of trans-membrane ion physiology</a> is available.
 
<p>
Although the simplest way to study the physics of free energy storage in such a gradient is by considering <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','freeGradient')">ideal particles all with zero potential energy</a>, the reality of the cell is that electrostatic interactions are critical.
Fortunately, the most important non-ideal effects of charge-charge interactions can be understood in terms of the usual <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','idealGas')">ideal particles</a> (which do not interact with one another) that do, however, feel the effects of a "background" electrostatic field. 
Such a mean-field picture is a simple approximation to the electrostatic effects induced primarily by having an excess of one or more charged species on a given side of a membrane - for example, the excess of $\plus{Na}$ ions in the extracellular environment.
</p>

<h3>
Two semi-ideal gases of ions in different potentials
</h3>

Unlike our examination of  <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','freeGradient')">two membrane-separated ideal gases</a>, the particles here are explicitly charged and they "feel" the electrostatic potential $\Phi$.
The positively charged anions schematically represent $\plus{K}$ ions interacting with the field generated by the imbalance of $\plus{Na}$ ions - the extracellular or "outside" concentration of sodium is maintained at a high value relative to the cytoplasm or "inside" by constant ATP-driven pumping.
However, <i>the effects of the $\plus{Na}$ concentration gradient will only be treated <b>implicitly</b> via the different values for $\inn{\Phi} < \out{\Phi}$.</i>


<p>
To be precise, the model consists of $N$ particles that do not interact with one another, but which interact with the external potential $\Phi$ as if each had a charge of $q$, leading to potential energy $q \cdot \Phi_{\mathrm{X}}$ for each particle, where X = "in" or "out".
The total volume $V$ is divided into inside and outside so that $\inn{V} + \out{V} = V$, with $\inn{N} + \out{N} = N$ ions populating the two compartments.
The whole system is maintained at constant temperature $T$. 
Particles can pass through the channel shown in the figure, but we assume it is closed so that $\inn{V}$ and $\out{V}$ are constants:
as shown in our discussion of <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','freeGradient')">two membrane-separated ideal gases</a>, the assumption is a convenience and not an approximation because the total system volume $V$ and particle-number $N$ are truly constant.
</p>


<h3>
Deriving the free energy
</h3>

We have two gases of ideal "ions" (that interact with the external potential but not with other ions).
Mathematically, we can largely follow our discussion of <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','freeGradient')">two membrane-separated ideal gases</a>.
The total free energy is the sum of the two ideal gas free energies and the two electrostatic potential energies:
\begin{align}
F(\inn{N}, \out{N}) = & \fidl( \inn{N}, \inn{V} ) + \fidl( \out{N}, \out{V} ) \nonumber \\
  & + \, \inn{N} q \, \inn{\Phi} + \out{N} q \, \out{\Phi}  
\end{align}
where $\fidl$ is defined in the <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','idealGas')">ideal gas page</a> and $q$ is the ionic charge.

<p>
Substituting for $\fidl$ and noting that $\out{N} = N - \inn{N}$, we have
\begin{align}
F (\inn{N}, N - \inn{N}) =  
   & \inn{N} \, k_B T \ln \frac{\inn{N} \, \lambda^3}{\inn{V}} \nonumber \\
   & + \,  (N - \inn{N}) \, k_B T \ln \frac{(N - \inn{N}) \, \lambda^3}{\out{V}}  \nonumber \\
   & + \, \inn{N} \, q \, \inn{\Phi} + (N - \inn{N}) \, q \, \out{\Phi} .
\end{align}

Because it is really the <i>difference</i> in electrostatic potential which governs the ionic behavior, we define $\dphi = \inn{\Phi} - \out{\Phi}$.
In terms of this quantity, we can rewrite the total free energy as
\begin{align}
F (\inn{N}, N - \inn{N}) =  
   & \inn{N} \, k_B T \ln \frac{\inn{N} \, \lambda^3}{\inn{V}} \nonumber \\
   & + \,  (N - \inn{N}) \, k_B T \ln \frac{(N - \inn{N}) \, \lambda^3}{\out{V}}  \nonumber \\
   & + \, N q \, \out{\Phi} + \inn{N} q \, \dphi ,
\label{fcombo}
\end{align}
</p>

Eq. \eqref{fcombo} is the free energy as a function of the number of particles inside the membrane (in volume $\inn{V}$).
Inclusion of the electrostatic effects shifts the location of the most probable state, or free energy minimum.

<h3>
The most probable concentrations: The Nernst equation
</h3>

If we open the channel and allow exchange of atoms between the compartments, the value of $\inn{N}$ can change.  
The probability of having $\inn{N}$ atoms in $\inn{V}$ is <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','freeGradient')">proportional to the Boltzmann factor of the free energy</a>: 
\begin{equation}
\label{ftoprob}
p(\inn{N}) \propto e^{ - \left.F(\inn{N}, \, N - \inn{N}) \right/ k_B T }
\end{equation}

<p>
The most probable $\inn{N}$ value therefore can be found by determining the minimum of $F$.
This will represent the <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','equil')">equilibrium</a> point in the thermodynamic limit (very large $N$ - when fluctuations about the most probable $\inn{N}$ will be very small compared to $\inn{N}$ itself).
We set $\dee F / \dee \inn{N} = 0$ in Eq. \eqref{fcombo}, then re-arrange and cancel terms to find
</p>
\begin{equation}
\label{derivzero}
0 = k_B T \ln \frac{\inn{N} \, \lambda^3}{\inn{V}} - k_B T \ln \frac{\out{N} \, \lambda^3}{\out{V}} + \left. q \dphi \right/ k_B T
\end{equation}
Combining the terms using the rules of logarithms, followed by exponentiation, we find the <b>Nernst equation</b>,
\begin{equation}
\label{nernst}
\mbox{Equilibrium: } \frac{ \inn{N} / \inn{V} }{ \out{N} / \out{V} } 
  = e^{-q \, \dphi / k_B T} 
\end{equation}
where you should recognize the left-hand side as the ratio of concentrations.

<p>
In words, Eq. \eqref{nernst} shows that <i>the concentrations inside and outside vary according to the Boltzmann factor of the ionic charge times the potential difference</i>. 
Such an equilibrium is called a Donnan equilibrium.
It should be comforting that when $\dphi = 0$, we recover <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','freeGradient')">equal concentrations</a>. 
</p>


<h3>
Comparison to cellular behavior
</h3>
As the exercise below will show, for some ions ($\minus{Cl}$, $\plus{K}$) the Nernst equation is a reasonable approximation.
This suggests that such ions permeate the membrane <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','passiveTransport')">passively</a>.
For some ions ($\plus{Na}$, $\dplus{Ca}$), the concentration ratios are very different from what would be predicted from the Nernst equation because the cell uses <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','transport')">active transport</a> to control them.


<h3>
Mass action and its limitations
</h3>
It is always worthwhile to pursue both thermodynamic <i>and</i> kinetic analyses of any system you really care about, or just to train yourself to consider a problem from multiple perspectives.
By comparison to the present case, some of the results from the <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','freeGradient')">truly ideal (uncharged) two-compartment system</a> may seem puzzling. 

<p>
In contrast to the uncharged system, we can see that the transport rates through the channel <i>cannot</i> be equal in the two directions. 
Let $k_{io}$ be the inside-to-outside rate constant and $k_{oi}$ be the reverse rate constant.
Starting from <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','equil')">detailed balance</a>, which says that the overall flows must be equal and opposite, and substituting the Nernst relation \eqref{nernst}, we find that
\begin{equation}
\label{balNernst}
\frac{ k_{oi} }{ k_{io} }
  = \frac{ \inn{N} / \inn{V} }{ \out{N} / \out{V} }
  = e^{-q \, \dphi / k_B T}
\end{equation}
</p>

In other words, the ratio of rates for an ion channel depends on the potential difference.
By itself, this does not contradict the <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','massAction')">mass action viewpoint</a> (that rate constants are independent of concentrations) ... so long as $\dphi$ is truly constant.
But if, more generally, $\dphi$ depends on the relative concentrations of the ion species moving through the channel, then the mass-action picture breaks down.
Such a breakdown would occur, for example, if there were two species of ions, one of which could not permeate the membrane and hence was maintained at fixed inside and outside concentrations: in this case, flow of the permeable ion would change $\dphi$ and, in turn, change the rate "constants".

<p>
The <a href="javascript:changeTo('ionsNernst','ionsOverview')">brief overview of trans-membrane ion physiology</a> may help to clarify the bigger picture of ion/membrane behavior.

Exercises
</h3>
<ol>
<li> Derive Eqs. \eqref{derivzero} and \eqref{nernst}.
<li> Use Eq. \eqref{nernst} to derive a concentration ratio for $\minus{Cl}$ using $\dphi = -90 \, \mathrm{mV}$ (typical for skeletal muscle) and compare your result to the experimental value of $\sim 1 / 30$.  This will require careful consideration of units when multiplying together physical constants. </li>
