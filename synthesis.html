<h2>
Biosynthesis is driven by free energy
</h2>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/synthesis-basic-eqn.gif" /></p>

Chemical syntheses in the cell, such as the formation of X-Y above, typically require an input of <a href="javascript:changeTo('synthesis','free')">free energy</a>.
Free energy could be supplied directly if there were an over-abundance of reactants (compared to <a href="javascript:changeTo('synthesis','equil')">equilibrium</a>) and/or a dearth of products.
More commonly, there is a complex sequence of reactions required for synthesis, and free energy drives these intermediate reactions.
Below, we see how the hydrolysis of <a href="javascript:changeTo('synthesis','atp')">ATP</a> can be coupled to a series of two synthesis reactions.
Other <a href="javascript:changeTo('synthesis','carriers')">carriers</a> could also supply the free energy to drive synthetic reactions.

<p>Note that if a synthetic reaction were favorable (did not require free energy), it would only be necessary for the cell to supply a <a href="javascript:changeTo('synthesis','catalysis')">catalyst</a>.
</p>


<h3>
Reaction coupling, driven by ATP
</h3>

An example of the mechanism here is the synthesis of glutamine from glutamic acid, where X-OH = glutmatic acid, Y-H = NH$_3$.  Below, -P = -O-PO$_3$.

<p>
The synthesis of X-Y can be coupled to ATP hydrolysis by the following two reactions 
</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/synthesis-mechanistic-eqns.gif" /></p>

The net result of the two reactions is the synthesis of X-Y <i>and</i> the hydrolysis of ATP.
Graphically the process looks like this
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/synthesis-schematic.gif" /></p>


<h3>
Steady-state analysis of the coupled reactions
</h3>

Will the two-step synthesis above really occur under typical cellular conditions, even if the direct synthesis ($X + Y \rightarrow XY$) is unfavorable?
We can answer this question using a steady-state analysis of the equations above in a <a href="javascript:changeTo('synthesis','massAction')">mass action</a> picture.
Specifically, we can calculate the rate of formation of XY (and Pi) in the second of the two reactions, which is marked with a green (*).
We use a <a href="javascript:changeTo('synthesis','steady')">steady-state condition</a> on the intermediate XP:
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/synthesis-steady-state.gif" /></p>

Because the last two terms are precisely the net rate of XY and Pi synthesis - based on Eq (*) - and the four terms together sum to zero in a steady state, we can rewrite the synthesis rate to see the dependence on ATP and ATP:
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/synthesis-rate.gif" /></p>
So long as the ratio $\conc{ATP} / \conc{ADP}$ is sufficiently large, the rate of XY synthesis will be positive.
And because <a href="javascript:changeTo('synthesis','atp')">ATP</a> is an <a href="javascript:changeTo('synthesis','carriers')">activated carrier</a> that ratio <i>is</i> large.

<p>
<b> Bottom line:</b> XY is synthesized at a positive rate if ATP is sufficiently activated.
