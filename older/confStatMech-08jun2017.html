<h2>
Conformational Statistical Mechanics
</h2>

Conformational transitions play a key role in biomolecular processes:
enzymes tend to close up over their substrates, transporters such as <a href="antiport">antiporters</a> often undergo an outward to inward-facing transition (facing one side of the bilayer or the other), and the steps taken by <a href="motors">molecular motors</a> are nothing other than very large scale conformational changes.
Examples of simple conformational changes  - without associated (un)binding - in this site's antiporter and molecular motor models are shown below:

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/kinesin-conf.png"  height="150"/></p>

<p>
Other sections of this website employ kinetic descriptions of conformational transitions, but here we want to probe the more detailed statistical mechanics.
</p>

<h3>
Equilibrium conformational statistical mechanics
</h3>

<p>
We'll consider a generic conformational transition between two states A and B, characterized by rate constants $\kab$ and $\kba$.
A and B could correspond to the numbered states shown above, for instance.
If we have a large number of copies $N$ of our molecule (or system) of interest which are in <a href="equil">equilibrium</a>, then some subset of these $N_A$ and $N_B$ are in the two states of interest.
Our discussion will apply even if there are other states besides A and B, so that
$N = N_A + N_B + N_C + N_D + \cdots$.
</p>

<p>
Equilibrium, as always, implies there is a balance of flows among states.
This can be stated in different ways:
\begin{align}
N_A \kab &= N_B \kba \nonumber \\
\conceq{A} \kab &= \conceq{B} \kba \; ,
\end{align}
where here $N_X$ refers to the equilibrium number of systems in state $X$ and $\conceq{X} = N_X / V$ refers to the equilibrium concentration in a volume $V$.
</p>

<p>
Statistical mechanics tell us how to derive "macroscopic" observable properties, such as the ratio of state populations $N_A/N_B$, from "microscopic" forces and energies.
Our microscopic description will employ classical physics, although the treatment of quantum properties is largely similar. 
For a good description of quantum statistical mechanics and the connections to a classical description, see the book by McQuarrie.
</p>

<p>
In classical statistical mechanics, we can derive observable properties solely by knowing the the potential energy $U$ as a function of the positions of all the atoms:
\begin{equation}
\rn = \left \{ (x_1, y_1, z_1), (x_2, y_2, z_2), \ldots \right \} \; .
\end{equation}
Knowing $U(\rn)$ is equivalent to knowing all the forces between atoms, because forces are derived simply from derivatives of $U$.
It is important that $U$ is a function of the atomic position that includes all the physics and chemistry you would expect - electrostatics, van der Waals interactions, and even complex stereochemical effects - and it should <i>not</i> be confused with the thermodynamic internal energy which is essentially the average energy for a given set of conditions. 
</p>

<p>
The essential guiding equation of equilibrium statistical mechanics is that the probability of a configuration $\rn$ (sometimes called a microstate) is given by the Boltzmann factor of the potential energy:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{prob}\left( \rn \right) \propto e^{ \left. -U \left(\rn \right) \right/ k_B T} \; ,
\end{equation}
where $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant and $T$ is the temperature in degrees Kelvin.
</p>

<p>
To extend this configuration-specific picture to conformational states, which are defined as large collections of configurations, we must sum up (integrate over) the probabilities of all the configurations consistent with a given state.  Thus, we have
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{prob} \left( \mbox{state A} \right) \propto
  \int_A d\rn \; e^{ \left. -U \left(\rn \right) \right/ k_B T} \; ,
\end{equation}
where the notation $\int_A$ indicates that we integrate over all configurations of state A, which could be defined as those which have a certain pair of atoms closer or further than some threshold distance.
</p>

<p>
We use the (relative) state populations to define the conformational free energies based on Boltzmann factors of <i>free</i> energies instead of potential energies:
\begin{align}
\frac{ \mathrm{prob} \left( \mbox{state A} \right) }{ \mathrm{prob} \left( \mbox{state B} \right) }
&= \frac { \int_A d\rn \; e^{ \left. -U \left(\rn \right) \right/ k_B T} }{ \int_B d\rn \; e^{ \left. -U \left(\rn \right) \right/ k_B T}  } \nonumber \\
&= \frac{ e^{ \left. -F_A \right/ k_B T} }{ e^{ \left. -F_B \right/ k_B T}  }
\simeq \frac{ e^{ \left. -G_A \right/ k_B T} }{ e^{ \left. -G_B \right/ k_B T}  }
\end{align}
where $F_X$ is the Helmholtz free energy of state X and $G_X$ is the Gibbs free energy.
The integrals used above strictly refer to the Helmholtz free energy, which is appropriate for constant volume, but the the constant-pressure Gibbs free energy will be very similar.  See the textbook by Zuckerman for a discussion of this issue.
</p>

<p>
Because the probability of a state is equal to the fraction of systems in that state, $\mathrm{prob} \left( \mbox{state X} \right) = N_X / N$, we can now re-write the original equilibrium balance condition in terms of free energies:
</p>
\begin{equation}
e^{ \left. -G_A \right/ k_B T} \kab = e^{ \left. -G_B \right/ k_B T} \kba
\end{equation}

Exercises UPDATE
</h3>
<ol>
<li> Explain the quantitative relationship between $k_B T$ which uses the Boltzmann constant and $RT$ which uses the gas constant.  To do this, convert $k_B T$ in MKS units for $T$ = 300K to units of kcal/mole. </li>
<li> For the reaction A + B $\rl$ C, starting from the explicit form of the Gibbs free energy \eqref{gmu}, derive the equilibrium relation $\mu_A + \mu_B = \mu_C$.  Use the fact that $N_C$ must increase when $N_A$ and $N_B$ decrease. </li>
